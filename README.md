# Smart Refrigeration System

**A cost-effective IoT solution designed to upgrade conventional cold storage rooms, preventing product spoilage and enhancing operational efficiency.**

---

## üí° The Problem
The fundamental challenge in traditional refrigeration is the lack of real-time electronic data. This leads to inefficient management, potential product spoilage, and a lack of control for the owner. Existing PLC-based smart systems are often too expensive, creating a global gap for an affordable and practical solution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Solution & Features
This project provides a practical and cost-effective solution by transforming standard refrigeration units into smart systems with key features:

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Uses a **DS18B20 sensor** to provide live temperature readings.
- **Smart Alerts:** Notifies the owner via the **Blynk application** and a **buzzer** if the temperature exceeds a specific limit.
- **Compressor Health Monitor:** A dedicated counter tracks the compressor's runtime (hours of operation), alerting the owner when maintenance (e.g., oil change) is due.
- **Fault Detection:** Sends an alert if a malfunction is detected (via a Cryo-one/Kryon-based anomaly detection).
- **Power Outage Alert:** The **TTGO ESP32 with its built-in battery and integrated SIM800L module** sends SMS alerts in the event of a power cut, ensuring the system remains operational.
- **Local Interface:** A small display on the control box shows the compressor's runtime, providing on-site information for technicians.
- **Remote Control:** The owner can remotely turn the compressor on or off using the **Blynk app**, allowing for control only when needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components
- **Microcontroller:** TTGO ESP32 (with integrated SIM800L module)
- **Temperature Sensor:** DS18B20
- **Power & Protection:** Optocouplers, relays, voltage converters, fuses, and a capacitor for stable power supply
- **Interface:** Small OLED screen and a buzzer for alerts

## üöÄ Future Features
- **Efficiency Monitoring:** Integrate sensors to measure the motor's efficiency and electricity consumption over time.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use data to predict potential failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance.
